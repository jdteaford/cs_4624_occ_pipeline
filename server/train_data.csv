What role might your race, ethnicity or prior experience with trauma play in your decision? If you have viewed them and are struggling with emotions, what can you do to help yourself and those you care about?\n\nCNN reached out to four trauma experts for their opinions: psychology professor Janet Helms, the director of the Institute for the Study and Promotion of Race and Culture at Boston College; Dr. Cheryl Singleton Al-Mateen, a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Virginia Commonwealth University and medical director at the Virginia Treatment Center for Children; and clinical psychologists Michele Cosby and Leslie Kimball, who are both assistant professors of psychiatry at the Virginia Treatment Center for Children.\n\nHere are their thoughts, edited lightly for clarity.\n\nLeslie Kimball: For adults who have had similar traumatic experiences, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s advisable not to watch the video without some opportunity to get support or to talk with someone else about it \xe2\x80\x93 isolation is dangerous.\n\nBut everyone may be deeply disturbed by these videos \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s our humanity, our empathy \xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful thing. It\xe2\x80\x99s also an awful thing that we are able to put ourselves in his shoes and feel his terror and helplessness. It was clear he knew what was happening and what was about to happen. It\xe2\x80\x99s secondary trauma \xe2\x80\x93 we are witnessing someone else\xe2\x80\x99s trauma, and so we experience a form of trauma.\n\nBe aware if you experience intrusive memories, or even flashbacks. And if you notice that starts to interfere with your daily activities \xe2\x80\x93 your sleep, your appetite, and certainly if you start having any unsafe thoughts about death or dying or hurting yourself \xe2\x80\x93 the first step is to talk with someone you trust, such as a mental health professional.\n\nWhen it comes to children, parents need to be careful. We can\xe2\x80\x99t protect children entirely from these realities, but we want their exposure to be developmentally appropriate. No, we would not want young children to watch these tapes, but we may want to have a conversation with them about what they may be hearing. For older children, maybe they watch a news story about it, but if an entire tape is being played, say \xe2\x80\x9cHey, let\xe2\x80\x99s not watch this part.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJanet Helms: I think White people have a duty to watch the videos, because if you don\xe2\x80\x99t watch as a White person, then you never know these things are happening in your name. So I think you have a duty to watch, to bear witness, to say, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not who I am; it\xe2\x80\x99s not who you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a different experience for Black and Indigenous people, because they are watching similar experiences with respect to violence in their own lives every week, and so this is just building trauma, upon trauma, upon trauma for Black people.\n\nIn retraumatization, whatever symptoms were experienced the first time, are going to be aggravated a second time, and perhaps more strenuously than the first time. It\xe2\x80\x99s racial PTSD, and my team has resources and a tool kit people can use at #racialtraumaisreal.\n\nI also think even people of color did not expect to see what happened to Mr. Floyd.\n\nAlthough people of color, particularly Black and Indigenous people, grow up knowing that they are likely to be victims of police violence, we don\xe2\x80\x99t typically see (police) spend such a prolonged amount of time killing a person.\n\nWatching them drain a person\xe2\x80\x99s life is particularly traumatic and not being able to help or prevent that yourself adds additional trauma to the situation.\n\nNow there\xe2\x80\x99s multiple trauma, reoccurring trauma, and also the knowledge that in these situations, no matter how many people are there, Black people are essentially helpless to prevent violence against one of their own.\n\nWhat I often recommend to Black people is that they recognize that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been traumatized, and that they need to take care of themselves by not watching those videos over and over again, if they can avoid it.\n\nThey can choose not to be a witness to this particular incident, to try to keep it out of their minds because it\xe2\x80\x99s more traumatizing to them.\n\nI say to them, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s okay to get help. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be strong in this situation. This is an inhuman situation, so seek therapy to help you get over your symptoms.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s really important that if they talk, they are with people who can understand the trauma, their feelings of anger and guilt \xe2\x80\x93 and not with someone who\xe2\x80\x99s going to discard it.\n\nOr with someone, if I may say, who\xe2\x80\x99s a White person who feels bad and wants the Black person to help the White person feel better. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a Black person\xe2\x80\x99s job to do that, it\xe2\x80\x99s the White person\xe2\x80\x99s job to do that for themselves.\n\nDr. Cheryl Singleton Al-Mateen: Understanding some of the issues related to structural racism in America is a process. People have to appreciate that it\xe2\x80\x99s there, and then understand more and more about how it impacts others as well as themselves.\n\nIf someone is really saying \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why should I care,\xe2\x80\x9d then maybe they should watch. And if somebody feels it\xe2\x80\x99s part of their journey in that process to see this, then OK. But if somebody feels like \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see it because it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be painful for me,\xe2\x80\x9d then I\xe2\x80\x99d say OK with that as well.\n\nAnd if someone\xe2\x80\x99s curious because they want to know about it, then \xe2\x80\x9cFair warning, this could be traumatic for you to watch.\xe2\x80\x9d But it may be something that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary for some people to see to understand what is happening.\n\nIt should not be necessary for someone to watch something that\xe2\x80\x99s traumatizing, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what their personal history of trauma is. What is a necessity is to listen, understand and believe.\n\nMichele Cosby: I would encourage any person of color to take emotional inventory of what they can handle. For me as a trauma therapist, I know I dare not watch something that is triggering for me in the middle of my workday when I may not be emotionally resourced to handle it.\n\nI encourage Black people to seek their own support. That could be structured or professional therapy. It can also be seeking out your spiritual leader or talking to loved ones who are seeing and experiencing very similar things.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s vicarious trauma. By hearing stories or witnessing and feeling the pain and the fear and the terror, it\xe2\x80\x99s as if you are going through the trauma yourself, because you\xe2\x80\x99re bearing witness to how that was for someone else. And especially for people of color watching, it also triggers their own life experiences, dealing with generations of racial trauma.\n\nAs a Black woman, I think what is often triggering is that it makes you think of your son, your uncle, your grandfather \xe2\x80\x93 all those people in your life that might encounter that situation.\n\nThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t a way to avoid it completely, but I think part of this is taking inventory of emotions, recognizing what your emotions are. So if I have no emotion, if I\xe2\x80\x99m numb, if my life experiences I associate with this leave me hopeless \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s something I probably need to deal with. If I\xe2\x80\x99m triggered with anger or guilt or desperation, then I need to figure out how to channel that for my own healing.\n\nAs a collective, this is not new for us, so having that shared experience can be helpful if it\xe2\x80\x99s being channeled in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cause you to self-destruct. It can easily trigger sadness, depression. Anxiety and fear are based out of not having control, and what those videos show is feeling out of control.\n"""
"b'On May 25, Minneapolis police officers arrested George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, after a convenience store employee called 911 and told the police that Mr. Floyd had bought cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill. Seventeen minutes after the first squad car arrived at the scene, Mr. Floyd was unconscious and pinned beneath three police officers, showing no signs of life.\n\nBy combining videos from bystanders and security cameras, reviewing official documents and consulting experts, The New York Times reconstructed in detail the minutes leading to Mr. Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s death. Our video shows officers taking a series of actions that violated the policies of the Minneapolis Police Department and turned fatal, leaving Mr. Floyd unable to breathe, even as he and onlookers called out for help.\n\nThe day after Mr. Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s death, the Police Department fired all four of the officers involved in the episode. On May 29, the Hennepin County attorney, Mike Freeman, announced third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges against Derek Chauvin, the officer seen most clearly in witness videos pinning Mr. Floyd to the ground. Mr. Chauvin, who is white, kept his knee on Mr. Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s neck for at least eight minutes and 15 seconds, according to a Times analysis of timestamped video. Our video investigation shows that Mr. Chauvin did not remove his knee even after Mr. Floyd lost consciousness and for a full minute and 20 seconds after paramedics arrived at the scene.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn June 3, Hennepin County prosecutors added a more serious second-degree murder charge against Mr. Chauvin and also charged each of the three other former officers \xe2\x80\x94 Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao \xe2\x80\x94 with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.\n\nOn June 18, the Hennepin County attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office said that its criminal complaint misstated the amount of time Mr. Chauvin kept his knee on Mr. Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s neck. The complaint originally said that Mr. Chauvin had done so for eight minutes and 46 seconds, a length of time that became a symbol and rallying cry for protesters. Responding to inquiries from journalists who noted a discrepancy with the durations listed in the complaint, the office said the actual time was seven minutes and 46 seconds. But The Times\xe2\x80\x99s own analysis of the video shows that this revised time is also incorrect.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes no difference,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jamar Nelson, who works with the families of crime victims in Minneapolis. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bottom line is, it was long enough to kill him, long enough to execute him.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'"
"b'The length of time prosecutors said a Minneapolis police officer planted his knee into George Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s neck \xe2\x80\x94 8 minutes and 46 seconds \xe2\x80\x94 has become a rallying cry for those seeking justice across the country.\n\nThe symbolism of 8:46 has been held up and embraced throughout the country in ways big and small. It has echoed in sanctuaries where Floyd has been memorialized, is starkly displayed on T-shirts and street art and is the length of moments of silence in Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s name.\n\nBut now, nearly three weeks after those charges were filed with 8:46 emphasized, the Hennepin County Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office on Wednesday acknowledged that the length of time is off by one minute. Now-fired officer Derek Chauvin had Floyd pinned to the pavement for 7 minutes and 46 seconds.\n\nThe publicized 8:46 comes down to a math error in the complaints signed by Matthew Frank, the assistant attorney general under Keith Ellison, who is heading the prosecution of the former officers. As of now, the County Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office has no plans to change any of the complaints.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese kinds of technical matters can be handled in future amendments to the criminal complaint if other reasons make it necessary to amend the complaint between now and any trials,\xe2\x80\x9d said office spokesman Chuck Laszewski.\n\nLaszewski also made it clear that \xe2\x80\x9cthe one-minute error made no difference in the decision to charge nor in the continuing legal hearings.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe complaints say that Chauvin \xe2\x80\x9cpulled Mr. Floyd out of the passenger side of the squad car at 8:19:38 p.m., and Mr. Floyd went to the ground face down and still handcuffed. \xe2\x80\xa6 The defendant placed his left knee in the area of Mr. Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s head and neck.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLater, the complaint read, \xe2\x80\x9cAt 8:27:24, the defendant removed his knee from Mr. Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe discrepancy was brought to the attention of the Star Tribune after a Seattle Times inquiry. A reporter first asked the County Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office about the time conflict on June 3, five days after the charges were filed.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is way too much stuff going on for anyone to look into this,\xe2\x80\x9d Laszewski said at the time. \xe2\x80\x9cUltimately, as this case moves along, if there is a discrepancy, it will have to be dealt with.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nStar Tribune inquiries continued until the error was acknowledged Wednesday. Laszewski declined to say why the office took so long to confirm the error.\n\nEric Nelson, Chauvin\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, declined to comment.\n\nEarl Gray represents Thomas Lane, who was pinning Floyd\xe2\x80\x99s legs. Gray was unaware of the incorrect calculation but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it changes the cases as they go forward for his client or the others.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho signs the criminal complaint isn\xe2\x80\x99t the person who testifies,\xe2\x80\x9d Gray said.\n\nStill, the change in time is unlikely to affect the widespread impact of 8:46.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the title of a Netflix commentary on police brutality by comedian Dave Chappelle that has been viewed by millions. From Boston to Tacoma, Wash., demonstrators held \xe2\x80\x9cdie-ins\xe2\x80\x9d for precisely 8 minutes, 46 seconds.\n\nIn the U.S. Capitol\xe2\x80\x99s Emancipation Hall, Democratic senators gathered, some standing, some kneeling on the marbled floor in silence for that length of time.\n\nMourners at the memorial service for Floyd in Minneapolis stood in silence for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, asked by the Rev.

The day before, Morries Hall, who was in a vehicle with Floyd the day he died, said he wanted to invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid any incriminating testimony.\n\n""I\'m fearful of criminal charges going forward. I have open charges that\'s not settled yet,"" Hall said.\n\n\nHall has been identified during trial testimony as a suspected drug dealer from whom Floyd obtained narcotics.\n\nMedical witnesses testify Floyd died of asphyxia\nThe prosecution has argued that Floyd died because of restraints by police officers, including Chauvin\'s knee pressed down on his neck during the arrest.\n\nFloyd\'s autopsy report concluded that he died of ""cardiopulmonary arrest, complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression,"" meaning that his heart and lungs stopped working. It did not specifically mention asphyxia.\n\nHowever, several medical witnesses testified that Floyd did die by asphyxia, among them world-renowned pulmonologist Dr. Martin Tobin, a Chicago doctor and breathing expert.\n\nWhile testifying on April 8, he led jurors through a series of demonstrations illustrating the pressure placed on Floyd\'s neck during the arrest, concluding he died from ""a low level of oxygen"" that damaged his brain and stopped his heart.

""In this case, it was primarily the evidence from the terminal events, the video evidence, that show Mr. Floyd in a position where he was unable to adequately breathe.""\n\nWhen Dr. Andrew Baker, the Hennepin County medical examiner who conducted Floyd\'s autopsy, took the stand earlier that same day, he said he didn\'t look at video of Floyd\'s arrest until after completing the report. He told jurors he believes the main cause of death was law enforcement restraint.\n\nWhen the defense questioned Baker on the lack of bruises on Floyd\'s neck and back, the doctor said, ""That\'s just not something that I think we see as medical examiners -- pressure to the back of the neck explaining strangulation.""\n\nMORE: Key takeaways from 2nd week of Derek Chauvin trial in the death of George Floyd\nDefense tries to sow reasonable doubt Floyd died due to police restraints\nWhile the prosecution argued that Floyd died due to police restraints used during his arrest, the defense countered that Floyd\'s heart disease and drug use -- fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in his system during an autopsy -- played a role in his death.\n\nA medical expert presented by the defense, Dr. David Fowler, said Floyd\'s heart condition, drug use and a potential stomach tumor played a ""significant"" role in his death.\n\nMORE: Key takeaways from 1st week of Derek Chauvin trial in the death of George Floyd\nHe also brought up another potential contributing factor not yet presented -- carbon monoxide exposure, from the tailpipe of a nearby police car while Floyd was pinned to the ground.\n\n""They contributed to Mr. Floyd having a certain cardiac arrest, in my opinion.

He said a person should be placed on their side at the first sign it appears they are in distress.\n\nSchleicher played a video clip of Floyd being held down and saying, ""my stomach hurt, my neck hurt, everything hurt"" and asking for water.\n\n""That would be some sort of an expression of pain, fair?""

Moseng is a retired Hennepin County paramedic who responded to the 4th Precinct police station in Minneapolis, where Floyd was taken following his 2019 arrest.\n\nMoseng said she examined Floyd and took his vitals, finding that while his blood pressure was high, he had a normal heart rate and respiratory rate.\n\nUnder questioning from Eldridge, Moseng testified that while speaking to Floyd, he told her that he had taken seven to nine Percocet pills, an opioid containing the pain reliever oxycodone. She said Floyd told her he took one of the pills as police officers approached the vehicle he was in.\n\n""I asked him why?"" Moseng testified.

The petition prompted prosecutors in the case to ask the appeals court to halt jury selection, contending Cahill did not have total jurisdiction as long as Supreme Court was considering Chauvin\'s request.\n\nDespite the petition from prosecutors on Monday to stay the trial, Cahill ruled that he was moving on with jury selection until the appeals court told him otherwise, which it never did.\n\nMORE: 2 more jurors picked for Derek Chauvin case, 1 says trial may force him to delay wedding\nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected Chauvin\'s petition, putting the decision on the third-degree murder count back on Cahill.\n\n""The court of appeals has said in a precedential opinion specifying the single-person rule applies to third-degree murder. I feel bound by that and I feel it would be an abuse of discretion not to grant the motion,"" Cahill said.\n\nPrior to the ruling, Chauvin\'s lawyer, Eric Nelson, presented an unsuccessful last-ditch argument on why he believed the third-degree murder should not be reinstated. Nelson contended that the Noor case was procedurally and factually different than the Chauvin case.\n\nMORE: The legal landscape of the Derek Chauvin trial\n""If you look at the facts of Noor, it\'s a Minneapolis police officer.

He cited other cases to support his argument, saying they all include some form of instrumentality, whether it be a gun or a vehicle used to run someone over.\n\nAdvertisement\n""Factually, there is no instrumentality here other than arguably Mr. Chauvin\'s knee,"" Nelson said.\n\nHe argued the cases are also procedurally different because Noor\'s appeal was filed after his conviction, and the Cauvin case is still in a pre-trial phase.\n\nThe prosecution\'s key evidence in the case against Chauvin is a bystander video of the May 25 arrest in which Chauvin, who is white, is seen kneeling on the back of Floyd\'s neck for more than nine minutes as the handcuffed and prone Black man repeatedly cried out, ""I can\'t breathe.""\n\nAttorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci, who represent the Floyd family, applauded Cahill\'s decision.\n\n""We\'re gratified that the judge cleared the way for the trial to proceed and for Chauvin to face this additional charge,"" Crump and Romanucci said in a statement. ""The trial is very painful and the family needs closure.

Schleicher asked.\n\n""Correct,"" Pleoger said.\n\nRecommended\n\nOUT NEWS\n\'Fair Play\' tackles what a fair trans-inclusive sports policy could look like\n\nWAR IN UKRAINE\nUkraine strikes the headquarters of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s Black Sea Fleet in Crimea\nThe question speaks directly to whether Chauvin violated police use-of-force policies, which is at the heart of the prosecution\'s case.\n\nDuring opening statements Monday, prosecutor Jerry Blackwell told the jury, ""The evidence is going to show you that there was no cause in the first place to use lethal force against a man who was defenseless, who was handcuffed, who was not resisting.""\n\nHe told the jurors that they would hear from Pleoger, the supervisor who took a call from 911 dispatcher Jena Scurry, who testified this week that she was concerned by what she saw on a live video feed of Floyd\'s arrest.\n\n""You can call me a snitch if you want to,"" Scurry told Pleoger, according to audio of the call. ""I don\'t know if they had used force or not. They got something out of the back of the squad, and all of them sat on this man.""\n\nScurry testified Monday that a ""gut instinct"" led her to call Pleoger. ""My instincts were telling me that something\'s wrong. Something\'s not right,"" Scurry testified. ""I don\'t know what, but something wasn\'t right.""\n\nPleoger testified that Chauvin did not immediately tell him that he placed his knee on Floyd\'s neck. Pleoger arrived at the scene after Floyd was taken away in an ambulance. He then went to the Hennepin County hospital where Floyd had been taken and he instructed Chauvin and another officer at the scene, Tou Thao, to do the same.\n\nPleoger said he again spoke with Chauvin at the hospital, and it was then that he learned Chauvin had put his knee on Floyd\'s neck, but he was not told how long pressure was applied. Pleoger testified that officers are trained to roll people on their side ""so they can breathe easier"" after they have been restrained in the prone position.\n\nThursday\'s testimony included appearances by two paramedics and another first responder, who talked about what happened after an ambulance arrived outside Cup Foods, the convenience store where a cashier claimed Floyd had used a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes. A 911 call from a clerk at the store touched off the fatal confrontation between police and Floyd.\n'"
"b'Last June, nearly a month after the death of George Floyd, the chief of the Minneapolis Police Department issued a blistering statement about the officers involved in Floyd\'s arrest.\n\nChief Medaria Arradondo, the first Black person to hold the position, described Floyd\'s death as ""tragic"" and said it ""was not due to a lack of training.""\n\n""This was murder \xe2\x80\x94 it wasn\'t a lack of training,"" Arradondo said, adding that that was why he ""took swift action"" and fired the four officers involved in the incident a day after Floyd\'s death.\n\n""The officers knew what was happening \xe2\x80\x94 one intentionally caused it, and the others failed to prevent it,"" Arradondo said in June.\n\nOn Monday \xe2\x80\x94 this time from the witness stand \xe2\x80\x94 Arradondo again rebuked Derek Chauvin, the former officer who prosecutors said knelt on Floyd\'s neck for 9 minutes, 29 seconds. It marked a rare instance of a police chief\'s testifying against a police officer. (Arradondo also testified in the trial of Mohamed Noor, a former police officer who was convicted of killing Justine Damond in 2017.)\n\nChauvin is on trial on charges of second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The three other officers who responded to the scene and were fired \xe2\x80\x94 J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao \xe2\x80\x94 are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter. They are scheduled to stand trial in August.\n\nProsecutor Steve Schleicher asked Arradondo whether he had a belief about when Chauvin\'s restraint of Floyd, including kneeling on his neck, should have ended.\n\n\nMinneapolis police chief testifies in Derek Chauvin trial\nAPRIL 5, 202102:46\n""Once Mr. Floyd had stopped resisting, and certainly once he was in distress and trying to verbalize that, that should have stopped,"" Arradondo responded.\n\n""There\'s an initial reasonableness in trying to just get him under control in the first few seconds,"" Arradondo said. ""But once there was no longer any resistance, and clearly when Mr. Floyd was no longer responsive and even motionless, to continue to apply that level of force to a person proned out, handcuffed behind their back, that in no way, shape or form is anything that is by policy. It is not part of our training, and it is certainly not part of our ethics or values.""\n\nThe prosecution has said Floyd died from Chauvin\'s kneeling on his neck. The defense has said Floyd\'s death was caused by an overdose, underlying health conditions and adrenaline. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner\'s Office classified Floyd\'s death as a homicide that occurred while he was being restrained by police.\n\nCause of death was listed as a ""cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression."" Under ""other significant conditions"" it said Floyd suffered from hypertensive heart disease, and listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use. Those factors were not listed under cause of death.\n\nDuring his testimony, Arradondo explained departmental policy on when force and de-escalation tactics are necessary. He said Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the force, failed to follow policies on de-escalation, use of force and the duty to render aid to people who need it when he knelt on Floyd\'s neck for more than 9 minutes. Floyd, who was Black, was recorded in a widely seen bystander video repeatedly telling Chauvin, who is white, that he could not breathe.\n\n""We have a duty of care, and so when someone\'s in our custody, regardless of if they are a suspect, we have an obligation to make sure that we provide for their care,"" Arradondo said.\n\nProsecutors have said that when Chauvin restrained Floyd, he violated a number of departmental policies that he had been trained in.\n\nPolice were called to Cup Foods, a convenience store, on May 25 after a cashier suspected that Floyd had used a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Arradondo said Monday that the offense Floyd was alleged to have committed would not typically result in someone\'s being taken into custody. Arrests, he said, are typically reserved for violent crimes. The statement called into question the officers\' use of force. Police body camera video played in court last week showed that Lane initially approached Floyd with his gun drawn.\n\nArradondo was asked whether Exhibit 17 \xe2\x80\x94 a photo from the bystander video that shows Chauvin looking up at bystanders while he knelt on a seemingly anguished Floyd \xe2\x80\x94 was within police departmental policy 5-300, authorizing the use of reasonable force, and whether Chauvin had used an authorized neck restraint.\n\n""A conscious neck restraint by policy mentions light to moderate pressure,"" he said. ""When I look at Exhibit 17, and when I look at the facial expression of Mr. Floyd, that does not appear in any way, shape or form that that is light to moderate pressure.""\n\nArradondo was also asked by Schleicher whether Chauvin followed departmental policy 5-304 regarding de-escalation. Arradondo said: ""I absolutely do not agree with that.""\n\nRecommended\n\nOUT NEWS\n\'Fair Play\' tackles what a fair trans-inclusive sports policy could look like\n\nWAR IN UKRAINE\nUkraine strikes the headquarters of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s Black Sea Fleet in Crimea\nArradondo\'s testimony was followed by that of 5th Precinct Inspector Katie Blackwell. At the time of Floyd\'s death, Blackwell was the commander of the training division.\n\nBlackwell was shown the same photo from bystander video that depicts Chauvin as he knelt on Floyd\'s neck. She, too, said that the restraint, as depicted, violated departmental policies and that neck restraints were not taught.\n\n""I don\'t know what kind of improvised position that is,"" Blackwell testified. ""So that\'s not what we train.""\n\nBlackwell said that she has known Chauvin for about 20 years.\n\nProsecutor Jerry Blackwell\'s opening statement last week forecast Arradondo\'s and Blackwell\'s testimony.\n\n""He will not mince any words,"" Blackwell had said of Arradondo. ""He is very clear. He\'d be very decisive that this was excessive force.""\n\nBlackwell said Arradondo would testify that Chauvin\'s ""conduct was not consistent"" with the police department\'s training and policies.\n\nUnder cross-examination, Chauvin\'s attorney, Eric Nelson, asked Arradondo when was the last time he had arrested a suspect. Arradondo said it had been ""many years.""\n\nNelson also revisited a claim he made in his opening statement that the crowd of bystanders who observed Floyd\'s arrest \xe2\x80\x94 some of whom cursed at the officers and many of whom shouted at Chauvin to get off Floyd \xe2\x80\x94 had hampered Chauvin\'s ability to render aid.\n\nArradondo agreed with Nelson that force is sometimes necessary. He told Schleicher that training has vastly improved since he joined the force more than 30 years ago.\n\nIn his statement in June, Arradondo said one of the officers on the scene told Chauvin that Floyd should be put in a recovery position, meaning turned on his side.\n\nArradondo and Blackwell testified Monday that it is important not to keep handcuffed people on their stomachs for long, because the prone position can make it difficult to breathe.\n\nArradondo testified that he learned of the incident about 9 p.m. May 25 from a deputy chief before Floyd had been pronounced dead. After he learned that Floyd had died, he went to his office at City Hall, where he viewed the city-operated street camera, which did not have audio and was farther away. He said he could see only the backs of the officers, so he did not fully gauge what had occurred.\n\nNot long after that, he said, he learned about the bystander video of Floyd\'s final moments that had been posted to Facebook.\n\n""Close to midnight, a community member had contacted me and said, \'Chief, have you seen the video of your officer choking and killing that man at 38th and Chicago?\'"" Arradondo said. ""And so once I heard that statement, I just knew it wasn\'t the same milestone camera video that I saw.""\n\nWithin minutes, he said, ""I saw for the first time what is now known as the bystander video.""\n\n\n\n'"
"b'A use-of-force expert testified Tuesday that former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin was justified when he knelt on George Floyd\'s neck as he tried to arrest him in May, contradicting testimony from other use-of-force experts and the police chief.\n\nThe defense witness, Barry Brodd, a former Santa Rosa, California, police officer, also said that he did not believe that the responding officers\' actions \xe2\x80\x94 pinning Floyd to the pavement while he was handcuffed facedown with Chauvin\'s knee on his neck for what prosecutors have said was 9 minutes, 29 seconds \xe2\x80\x94 qualified as a use of force. He said that he believed it was a ""control hold"" and that he did not think Chauvin was inflicting any pain on Floyd.\n\n""I felt that Derek Chauvin was justified and was acting with objective reasonableness, following Minneapolis Police Department policy and current standards of law enforcement, in his interactions with Mr. Floyd,"" Brodd said.\n\nChauvin is on trial charged with second- and third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the death of Floyd, 46.\n\nBrodd testified that the prone position in which Floyd was kept was safe and that it was an accepted way to control someone during an arrest.\n\nVeteran officers from inside and outside the Minneapolis Police Department, including Chief Medaria Arradondo, have said Chauvin used excessive force and violated a number of department policies he had been trained in.\n\n\nApril 5: Police chief testified Chauvin\'s use of force against Floyd \'violates\' policy\nAPRIL 5, 202103:35\nUnder cross-examination by prosecutor Steve Schleicher, Brodd backpedaled on a number of statements he made when he was questioned by the defense. Schleicher showed Brodd a photo of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\'s neck. Floyd appeared to be in pain in the photo. Brodd conceded that restraining a person in such a way could inflict pain.\n\nSchleicher also played body camera video that recorded Floyd saying ""I can\'t breathe"" and ""Everything hurts"" and telling the officers that he was in pain. Schleicher asked Brodd whether he had counted how many times Floyd said he could not breathe. Brodd said he had not. Brodd also testified that he had heard Floyd say those things during his review of the videos but that he did not ""note it.""\n\nBrodd, a longtime police instructor who is now a private consultant, testified in the trial of Jason Van Dyke, a white Chicago police officer who shot and killed Laquan McDonald, a Black 17-year-old, in 2014. Van Dyke shot Laquan, who was walking down the street away from police while holding a knife, 16 times. Brodd testified that the shooting was justified. Van Dyke was convicted of murder in 2018.\n\n""It\'s easy to sit and judge in an office on an officer\'s conduct,"" Brodd told Chauvin\'s attorney, Eric Nelson. ""It\'s more of a challenge to, again, put yourself in the officer\'s shoes to try to make an evaluation through what they\'re feeling, what they\'re sensing, the fear they have, and then make a determination.""\n\nBrodd was one of six witnesses the defense called Tuesday as it began presenting its case.\n\nProsecutors rested their case Tuesday morning. They sought to prove to the jury that Floyd died from asphyxia, or insufficient oxygen, from Chauvin\'s kneeling on his neck.\n\nThe defense has argued that Chauvin, a 19-year Minneapolis police veteran, acted according to his training and that Floyd\'s use of illegal drugs and his underlying health conditions caused his death.\n\nDr. Andrew Baker, the Hennepin County medical examiner who performed an autopsy on Floyd and declared his death a homicide, testified last week that fentanyl and heart disease were contributing factors but that the police officers\' actions were the main cause.\n\nThe teenager who recorded the widely seen bystander video of Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd, who was Black, was among nearly 40 witnesses called to the stand by the prosecution. Prosecutors also called two ""spark of life"" witnesses to humanize Floyd \xe2\x80\x94 his girlfriend, Courteney Ross, and his brother Philonise Floyd.\n\nThe testimony of other medical experts, including a world-renowned pulmonologist, bolstered prosecution claims that Floyd died from being held down by Chauvin.\n\n""A healthy person subjected to what Mr. Floyd was subjected to would have died,"" Dr. Martin J. Tobin, a pulmonologist and critical care physician, testified Thursday.\n\nChauvin and three other officers involved in Floyd\'s arrest \xe2\x80\x94 J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao \xe2\x80\x94 were fired the day after Floyd died. Kueng, Lane and Thao are scheduled to stand trial in August on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter. Floyd\'s death sparked international protests against racism and police brutality.\n\nPolice had been called to Cup Foods, a convenience store, on May 25 after a cashier suspected that Floyd had used a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes.\n\nThe defense started laying out its case Tuesday with testimony from two people who were involved in a traffic stop in which Floyd was arrested May 2019.\n\nBefore the testimony of Scott Creighton, a retired Minneapolis police officer, and Michelle Moseng, the paramedic who treated Floyd after his arrest, Judge Peter Cahill told the jurors that they would hear evidence of an occurrence for the ""limited purpose of showing the effects the ingestion of opioids may or may not have had"" on Floyd\'s physical well-being and that it was not evidence about his character.\n\nRecommended\n\nOUT NEWS\n\'Fair Play\' tackles what a fair trans-inclusive sports policy could look like\n\nWAR IN UKRAINE\nUkraine strikes the headquarters of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s Black Sea Fleet in Crimea\nProsecutors had tried to exclude video and testimony about the arrest. Cahill limited what could be introduced.\n\nParts of body camera video from the encounter showed Creighton approaching Floyd with his gun drawn. At one point, Floyd, who was in the passenger seat, said, ""Don\'t shoot me, man!"" before he was pulled from the car and handcuffed.\n\nCreighton testified that Floyd was ""noncompliant"" to his commands to show his hands.\n\nUnder cross-examination by prosecutor Erin Eldridge, Creighton admitted that he had cursed at Floyd and had given him conflicting commands about where to place his hands. He testified that ""it escalated real quick."" Eldridge also pointed out that Floyd did not go to the ground \xe2\x80\x94 as he did during his arrest in May.\n\nCreighton agreed.\n\n""Mr. Floyd didn\'t drop dead while you were interacting with him, correct?"" Eldridge asked.\n\n""No,"" Creighton responded.\n\nMoseng, the paramedic who treated Floyd and has since retired, testified that Floyd told her that he had been taking Percocet, an opioid, every 20 minutes that day and was addicted to them. She did not testify that he had swallowed them as the police approached, as the defense has claimed he did in May outside Cup Foods.\n\nMoseng acknowledged that Floyd was alert and able to walk, that he obeyed commands and that she had written in her report on his health that his respiration and pulse rates were normal. Moseng testified that Floyd\'s blood pressure was high and that she recommended taking him to the hospital. She said that he was initially resistant to go but that she eventually took him. Asked whether she could recall whether he was monitored for two hours and released, as records indicate, Moseng said she did not know.\n\nMinneapolis Park Police Officer Peter Chang and Shawanda Hill, who was in an SUV with Floyd before his encounter with Chauvin, also testified Tuesday.\n\nHill said that Floyd was ""happy, normal, talking, alert"" when they crossed paths at Cup Foods and that he offered to give her a ride home. When they went to his SUV, she said, ""he fell asleep.""\n\nHill said that when Cup Foods employees approached Floyd in the SUV about the $20 bill, Floyd was already sleeping. She said she and the employees tried ""to wake him up ... over and over.""\n\n""He woke up, he\'ll say something, made a little gesture and nodded back off,"" she said, adding that he was tired because he had been working.\n\nShe said he seemed startled when he realized police had arrived.\n\nWhen he saw an officer at the window with his gun drawn, Floyd ""instantly grabbed the wheel and he was like: \'Please, please, don\'t kill me. Please, please, don\'t shoot me. Don\'t shoot me. What did I do? Just tell me what I did. Please, don\'t kill. Please, don\'t shoot me,\'"" Hill testified.\n\n\nMinneapolis Park Police officer says crowd was \'loud and aggressive\' during Floyd\'s arrest\nAPRIL 13, 202102:16\nFor the first time, the jury saw video from Chang\'s body-worn camera. Chang said he was stationed at a nearby park when he responded outside Cup Foods to assist. When he arrived, Floyd was handcuffed and seated on the sidewalk, telling an officer his name and his birthdate. Chang was asked to look up Floyd\'s information. He said he then returned to the squad car where Lane and Kueng were struggling with Floyd and that they told him to watch Floyd\'s SUV.\n\nChang testified that the bystanders were ""very aggressive toward the officers"" and that he was concerned for their safety, but under cross-examination he said that the officers did not radio for help, so he assumed they were OK. He said his focus was on Hill and Morries Hall, who was also with Floyd in the SUV that day.\n\nNelson has not said whether Chauvin will take the stand.\n'"
"b'The US has been convulsed by nationwide protests over the death of an African-American man in police custody.\n\nGeorge Floyd, 46, died after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nFootage of the arrest on 25 May shows a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd\'s neck while he was pinned to the floor.\n\nMr Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with murder.\n\nTranscripts of police bodycam footage show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained by the officers.\n\nThe key events that led to Mr Floyd\'s death happened within just 30 minutes. Based on accounts from witnesses, video footage and official statements, here\'s what we know so far.\n\nShort presentational grey line\nIt began with a report of a fake $20 (\xc2\xa316.20) bill.\n\nA report was made on the evening of 25 May, when Mr Floyd bought a pack of cigarettes from Cup Foods, a grocery store.\n\nBelieving the $20 bill he used to be counterfeit, a store employee reported it to police.\n\nMr Floyd had been living in Minneapolis for several years after moving there from his native Houston, Texas. He had recently been working as a bouncer in the city but, like millions of other Americans, was left jobless by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn pictures: Unrest spreads across US\nWhy has a US city gone up in flames?\nMr Floyd was a regular at Cup Foods. He was a friendly face, a pleasant customer who never caused any trouble, the store owner Mike Abumayyaleh told NBC.\n\nBut Mr Abumayyaleh was not at work on the day of the incident. In reporting the suspicious bill, his teenage employee was just following protocol.\n\nIn a call to 911, made at 20:01, the employee told the operator he had demanded the cigarettes back but ""he [Floyd] doesn\'t want to do that"", according to a transcript released by authorities.\n\nThe employee said the man appeared ""drunk"" and ""not in control of himself"", the transcript says.\n\nShortly after the call, at around 20:08, two police officers arrived. Mr Floyd was sitting with two other people in a car parked around the corner.\n\nAfter approaching the car, one of the officers, Thomas Lane, pulled out his gun and ordered Mr Floyd to show his hands. In an account of the incident, prosecutors do not explain why Mr Lane thought it necessary to draw his gun.\n\nMr Lane, prosecutors said, ""put his hands on Mr Floyd, and pulled him out of the car"". Then Mr Floyd ""actively resisted being handcuffed"".\n\nOnce handcuffed, though, Mr Floyd became compliant while Mr Lane explained he was being arrested for ""passing counterfeit currency"".\n\nCourt transcripts from police body cameras show Mr Floyd appears co-operative at the beginning of the arrest, repeatedly apologising to the officers after they approach his parked car.\n\nMr Lane asks Mr Floyd to show his hands at least 10 times before ordering him to get out of the vehicle.\n\nIt was when officers tried to put Mr Floyd in their squad car that a struggle ensued.\n\n\nMedia caption,\nMinnesota governor on George Floyd death: \'Thank God a young person had a camera to video it\'\n\nAt about 20:14, Mr Floyd ""stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic"", according to the report.\n\nMr Chauvin arrived at the scene. He and other officers were involved in a further attempt to put Mr Floyd in the police car.\n\nDuring this attempt, at 20:19, Mr Chauvin pulled Mr Floyd away from the passenger side, causing him to fall to the ground, the report said.\n\nHe lay there, face down, still in handcuffs.\n\nThat\'s when witnesses started to film Mr Floyd, who appeared to be in a distressed state. These moments, captured on multiple mobile phones and shared widely on social media, would prove to be Mr Floyd\'s last.\n\nTwitter hides Trump tweet for \'glorifying violence\'\nMr Floyd was restrained by officers, while Mr Chauvin placed his left knee between his head and neck.\n\nFor more than nine minutes, Mr Chauvin kept his knee on Mr Floyd\'s neck, the prosecutors say. The duration was initially given as eight minutes and 46 seconds but Minnesota prosecutors have since revised the time.\n\nThe transcripts of bodycam footage from officers Lane and J Alexander Kueng show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained. He was also pleading for his mother and begging ""please, please, please"".\n\nAt one point, Mr Floyd gasps: ""You\'re going to kill me, man.""\n\nDerek Chauvin, 44, is due to appear in court in Minneapolis on Monday\nIMAGE SOURCE,REUTERS\nImage caption,\nDerek Chauvin is charged with second degree murder\nOfficer Chauvin replies: ""Then stop talking, stop yelling.

I\'m dead.""\n\nA female bystander told the police: ""His nose is bleeding, come on now.""\n\nAbout six minutes into that period, Mr Floyd became non-responsive. In videos of the incident, this was when Mr Floyd fell silent, as bystanders urged the officers to check his pulse.\n\nOfficer Kueng did just that, checking Mr Floyd\'s right wrist, but ""couldn\'t find one"". Yet the other officers did not move.\n\nAt 20:27, Mr Chauvin removed his knee from Mr Floyd\'s neck.

He had advised Mr Floyd to contact a temporary jobs agency.\n\nForgery, he said, was out of character for Mr Floyd.\n\n""The way he died was senseless,"" Harris said. ""He begged for his life. He pleaded for his life.
